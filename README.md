# Portfolio

This is my porfolio where I showcase what I've been up to during my time at the CraftAcademy Bootcamp.

### Synopsis

This project is website built with the Middleman-framework. I've used bootstrap 4 as a css-framwork, added effects with jQuery, used a YAML-file as a static database and presented the data with ruby and html convereted to HAML

### Motivation

We are learning HTML, JavaScript, CSS and having all the parts and bits working together. Building a portfolio from scratch is definitely a good way of learning and practicing these different languages.

## So how does it look?

Well fortunately for you I've added my site to GitHub-pages so you can see my portfolio right here --> https://davidboll.github.io/portfolio/ I've also deployd on my own domain - https://portfolio.davidboll.se/ :)

## Acconlegements

I would like to thank the coaches of CraftAcademy

I've used some code that I found google'ing to make my site look a lot cooler than it would have without it, so here's a big thumbs up to @rasheedbhutto (https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/PA4ab) and @tasos (https://jsfiddle.net/vduucu87/) <3
